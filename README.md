# Welcome to My Personal Website!

This project is a hands-on experiment where I've delved into the world of Svelte and Tailwind CSS to enhance my skills and create a unique web presence. This README.md will guide you through the project and help you understand its structure and purpose.

## Technologies Used

- **Svelte:** The core of this project is built using Svelte, a modern and reactive JavaScript framework that allows for efficient and elegant web development.

- **Tailwind CSS:** To style and design the website, I've utilized Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that streamlines the styling process and provides a clean and maintainable codebase.
